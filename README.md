# Using-regex


READ ME

In order to understand the search pattern defined by a regex, a web development student would want a tutorial explaining that regex.

An example regex tutorial would contain a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to separate sections explaining what each component of the regex does, and a section about the author with a link to their GitHub profile. Reading through each section of the tutorial, I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial when I click on the links in the table of contents. After I reach the end of the tutorial, I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does. Then I find a section about the author and a link to the authorâ€™s GitHub profile.
